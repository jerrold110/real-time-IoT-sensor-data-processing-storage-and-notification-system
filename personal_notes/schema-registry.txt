Schema registry provides a centralized repository for managing and validating schemas for  topic message data,
for ser and deser of the data. Producers and consumers to topics can use
schemas to ensure data consistencey and compatibility as schemas evolve.

I have to register schemas. A schema defines the structure of message data and acts as a blueprint
for data.
