Messages follow a key value format
Messages are written to topics which is an abstraction of an event log
Topics are partitioned (spread over kafka brokers)
Events with the same event key are written to the same partition and a consumer of a partition will always read that parition's events in the order it was written

In the case of our notification system:
The consumer processor will either be Flink or Kafka streams. Since we are monitoring for temperatures for each sensor to know when to turn off a sensor
the key should be the sensor's ID.
